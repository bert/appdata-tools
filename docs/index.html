<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>
Every software center that exists allows the user to look at screenshots
and a long description of the application before it is installed.
For most users it allows them to answer the question <i>Do I want to install this application?</i>
</p>
<p>
Traditionally in Linux distributions, we have <b>none</b> of this data for the
vast majority of our desktop user-installable applications.
To solve this, we have defined a new data file, which the upstream project can
optionally translate using the same technique as GSetting schemas or
<a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/">Desktop files</a>.
Rather than create a new schema from scratch, we'll be using a subset of the
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/">AppStream</a>
metadata proposal.
</p>

<p>
Applications wishing to have long descriptions, screenshots and other useful things
are required to ship one or more files in <code>/usr/share/appdata/%{id}.appdata.xml</code>.
</p>

<h1>File specification</h1>
<h2>Sample file</h2>
<p>
The file should contain something like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!-- Copyright 2013 First Lastname &lt;your@email.com&gt; --&gt;
&lt;application&gt;
 &lt;id type="desktop"&gt;gnome-power-statistics.desktop&lt;/id&gt;
 &lt;licence&gt;CC0&lt;/licence&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Power Statistics&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Observe power management&lt;/summary&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Power Statistics is a program used to view historical and current battery
   information and will show programs running on your computer using power.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example list:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  You probably only need to install this application if you are having problems
  with your laptop battery, or are trying to work out what programs are using
  significant amounts of power.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;screenshots&gt;
  &lt;screenshot type="default" width="800" height="600"&gt;http://www.hughsie.com/en_US/main.png&lt;/screenshot&gt;
  &lt;screenshot width="800" height="600"&gt;http://www.hughsie.com/en_US/preferences.png&lt;/screenshot&gt;
 &lt;/screenshots&gt;
 &lt;url type="homepage"&gt;http://www.gnome.org/projects/en_US/gnome-power-manager&lt;/url&gt;
 &lt;updatecontact&gt;gnome-power-manager-list@gnome.org&lt;/updatecontact&gt;
 &lt;project_group&gt;GNOME&lt;/project_group&gt;
&lt;/application&gt;
</pre>

<a name="id"/><h2><code>&lt;id/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
The <code>%{id}</code> is the same name as the installed .desktop file for the
application.
</p>

<a name="licence"/><h2><code>&lt;licence/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
The <code>&lt;licence&gt;</code> tag is indicating the content licence that you
are releasing the one AppData text file as.
<b>This is not typically the same as the project licence.</b>
By ommitting the licence value would probably mean your data would not be
incorporated into the distribution metadata.
Permissible licence codes include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CC0</code></li>
<li><code>CC-BY</code></li>
<li><code>CC-BY-SA</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The licence codes correspond to the full licence texts as given by the
  list of free content licences according to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing">Fedora</a>.
  For instance, <code>CC-BY-SA</code> corresponds to <code>
  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</code>
</p>

<a name="name"/><h2><code>&lt;name/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
You can omit this tag if you want the software center to have the same strings
as the desktop menu.
In some cases it might be required to have a different name in the app-store,
but most <code>appdata.xml</code> files will not need this.
</p>


<a name="summary"/><h2><code>&lt;summary/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
You can omit this tag if you want the software center to have the same strings
as the desktop menu.
In some cases it might be required to have a different name in the app-store,
but most <code>appdata.xml</code> files will not need this.
</p>


<a name="description"/><h2><code>&lt;description/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
The long description is an important part of the file.
Important things to consider when writing the application description:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Include 2-3 paragraphs of interesting easy to read prose.</li>
<li>Ensure you provide a description of what the application actually does.</li>
<li>Describe any important features.</li>
<li>Do not use possily trademarked product names when refering to competitors.</li>
<li>Break down each paragraph into easily translated paragraphs.</li>
<li>Use lists sparingly.</li>
<li>Never refer to installable items as packages.</li>
<li>Never start the first sentance with <i>This application...</i></li>
<li>Try not use more than 100 words.</li>
<li>Do not be too geeky. Aim for an intelligent semi-technical reader.</li>
<li>Don't mention what language an application is written in, users don't care</li>
<li>Only mention what the application can do now, rather than what is planned</li>
</ul>
<p>
Do not assume the format is HTML. Only paragraph, ordered list and unordered list are supported at this time.
</p>

<a name="screenshots"/><h2><code>&lt;screenshots/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
A screenshot presents your application to the outside world, and will probably
be seen by hundreds or thousands of people.
Screenshots are only fetched by the software center when the long description is
shown and are usually mirrored by the distribution to avoid increasing
upstream project hosting costs.
</p>
<p>
Screenshots are an incredibly important part of how users choose what
applications to install, so it's important to get them right.
Consistent, good looking screenshots will make your application look more
attractive and will expand your userbase.
Consistent screenshots also mean the software center looks cohesive, and not a
set of random packages bolted together.
</p>
<p>
The following are some guidelines for how to take screenshots of applications:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the desktop defaults - use the default wallpaper, font and visual theme.
    Avoid including your own tweaks or use of non-standard extensions in the
    screenshot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Aim to crop images with a 16:9 aspect ratio to avoid showing letterboxed
    screenshots.
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on one thing in your screenshots. Lots of overlapping windows make it
    hard for people to understand what you are showing them.
    Demonstrate one thing in each screenshot and don't show anything else at the
    same time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try not to show the background in the screenshots.
    If you need a background for your window, use the default wallpaper.
    Crop your image to exclude irrelevant detail and make sure you use an alpha
    mask if the window has curved corners.
    Don't assume the screenshot will be shown on a white background.
    When using the default desktop screenshot tool, take a window screenshot,
    and include the window borders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not resize the screenshots below the native size.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screenshots often need to feature content, such as images, documents,
    web pages or videos.
    Don’t show the ‘empty’ default view of your application, if you can avoid it.
    Try and use high quality content that contains positive associations, and
    which will have a broad appeal.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must avoid content that might be considered offensive or controversial.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid showing personal data too. Remember, this will be seen by the internet
    at large.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the screenshot is supposed to be used for an international or unknown
    audience, try to use US English, otherwise, use the local language.
    But if in doubt, use US English.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not take a screenshot that includes the mouse pointer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the lossless PNG format where possible, unless showing large images
    where a lossy format JPEG format may compress much better.
    Other file formats are not currently supported.
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="url"/><h2><code>&lt;url/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
Links of type <code>homepage</code> should be a link to the upstream homepage
for the application.
</p>

<a name="updatecontact"/><h2><code>&lt;updatecontact/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
AppData is a new standard, and we'll likely be adding extra metadata in the
future.
If you include the <code>&lt;updatecontact&gt;</code> tag then someone
will send an email when the standard is updated, detailing the new fields that
you may or may not want to add to your <code>appdata.xml</code> file.
We're not expecting to do this more than 4 times a year, so don't expect a
deluge of email.
</p>
<p>
<b>TIP:</b>Use <code>_at_</code> rather than <code>@</code> if you're worried
about the email address being harvested by spammers.
</p>

<a name="project_group"/><h2><code>&lt;project_group/&gt</code></h2>
<p>
If you include the <code>&lt;project_group&gt;</code> tag then this identifies
your project with a specific upstream umbrella project.
Known values include <code>GNOME</code>, <code>KDE</code>, <code>XFCE</code>,
<code>MATE</code> and <code>LXDE</code>, although other umbrella projects like
<code>Yorba</code> would make sense too.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>You should only identify with an umbrella project if you use all
their infrastructure and policies, for instance string freezes dates, bugtracker
and source control instance.
</p>

<h1>Questions:</h1>
</ul>

<a name="translation"/><h3>How do I translate this data?</h3>
<p>
 If you ship an <code>.xml.in</code> file rather than an <code>.xml</code> file,
 you can use intltool to translate the data.
 You can also use itstool to translate the data, and we've provided a
 <a href="appdata.its"><code>appdata.its</code></a> file for convenience.
</p>
<p>
 Translated descriptions are a really nice feature, as only a fraction of the
 userbase installing application will be able to understand English text.
</p>

<a name="package"/><h3>Why not just use the package description?</h3>
<p>
 Different distros cut and join different source packages in different ways,
 plus, it's not typically translated.
</p>

<a name="doap"/><h3>Why not just use the DOAP description?</h3>
<p>
 This is one file per-project and is not suitable when one tarball will install
 several applications. It's also not translatable.
</p>

<a name="web-service"/><h3>Why not just use a centralized web service?</h3>
<p>
 Put simply, we don't have the resources to moderate, check and translate each
 string for every application. We don't have the legal framework so that
 non-free applications could also ship application data.
</p>
<p>
 The upstream project is in a much better place to describe itself, and the
 upstream project is able to use it's existing localization and translation teams.
 Also, things like the screenshot will change as the project is updated, and
 not all distros ship the same version of an application.
 We also want the long description to come up immediately, and be searchable,
 so we can't really use a web service in that case.
 Additionally, different distros have different policies on trademarks.
</p>

<a name="how-about-no"/><h3>What happens if I don't ship this file?</h3>
<p>
 The GNOME Software Center currently shows a nag message that the upstream project
 doesn't ship the additional data.
 Additionally, we will penalize apps that do not ship the extra metadata by showing
 them lower in the search results.
</p>

<a name="other-data"/><h3>What other data should I include in the file?</h3>
<p>
 At this moment we're trying to do the bare minimum for a software center technical
 preview.
 In the future I can totally see this file being used to express what portals
 are required (i.e. <i>Firefox needs access to your addressbook</i>) and other
 useful things.
 I'll update this page when we've got some more concrete use-cases.
</p>

<a name="why-xml"/><h3>Why XML and not JSON/other?</h3>
<p>
 AppData is a subset of the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/">AppStream</a>
 schema, which is also XML.
</p>

<a name="use"/><h3>Where will this data be used?</h3>
<p>
 We will scrape this data when building and composing distributions, and depending
 on the implementation will either use an OCS server or directly copy the AppData
 data into the AppStream metadata.
</p>

<a name="validate"/><h3>How do I know if my appdata XML is correct?</h3>
<p>
There are several ways to validate the data:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the appdata-validate command available in <a href="https://github.com/hughsie/appdata-tools">appdata-tools</a></li>
<li>Using a XSD schema <a href="https://raw.github.com/hughsie/appdata-tools/master/data/appdata.xsd">available online</a> or installed in <code>/usr/share/appdata/schema</code> when is appdata-tools is installed.
<li>Using a RELAX NG schema available in <a href="appdata.rng">XML syntax</a> and
<a href="appdata.rnc">compact syntax</a> form.</li>
</ul>
 
<a name="example"/><h3>Have you got a real world example?</h3>
<p>
 See the commit that added the non-translated AppData metadata to
 <a href="example.patch">gnome-power-manager</a> or the translated metadata to
 <a href="example-intltool.patch">gnome-color-manager</a>.
