<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>
Every software center that exists allows the user to look at screenshots
and a long description of the application before it is installed.
For most users it allows them to answer the question <i>Do I want to install this...</i>
</p>
<p>
In Linux, we have <b>none</b> of this data for the vast majority of our desktop
user-installable applications.
What we need to do is define a new data file, which the upstream project can
optionally translate using the same technique as GSetting schemas or
<a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/â€Ž">Desktop files</a>.
Rather than create a new schema from scratch, we'll be using a subset of the
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/">AppStream</a>
metadata proposal.
</p>
<p>
Since this data is per-application, rather than per-project or per-package we
can use the .desktop name as the ID for the data.
This means we can extract this data and add it to any
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/">AppStream</a>-or-similar
metadata consumed by the software center.
</p>

<h1>Proposal:</h1>
<p>
Applications wishing to have long descriptions, screenshots and other useful things
are required to ship one or more files in <code>/usr/share/appdata/%{id}.appdata.xml</code>.
The <code>%{id}</code> is the same name as the installed .desktop file for the
application. This file will contain something like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;application&gt;
 &lt;id type="desktop"&gt;gnome-power-statistics.desktop&lt;/id&gt;
 &lt;licence&gt;CC0&lt;/licence&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;Power Statistics&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Observe power management&lt;/summary&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Power Statistics is a program used to view historical and current battery
   information and will show programs running on your computer using power.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Example list:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  You probably only need to install this application if you are having problems
  with your laptop battery, or are trying to work out what programs are using
  significant amounts of power.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/description&gt;

<h1>Questions:</h1>
<h3>What format should the description be?</h3>
<p>Important things to consider when writing the application description:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include 2-3 paragraphs of interesting easy to read prose.</li>
<li>Ensure you provide a description of what the application actually does.</li>
<li>Describe any important features.</li>
<li>Do not use possily trademarked product names when refering to competitors.</li>
<li>Break down each paragraph into easily translated paragraphs.</li>
<li>Use lists sparingly.</li>
<li>Never refer to installable items as packages.</li>
<li>Never start the first sentance with <i>This application...</i></li>
<li>Try not use more than 100 words.</li>
<li>Do not be too geeky. Aim for an intelligent semi-technical reader.</li>
<li>Do not assume the format is HTML. Only paragraph, ordered list and unordered list are supported at this time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why include Name and Summary data if it's already in the .desktop file?</h3>
<p>
 You can omit the <code>&lt;name&gt</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt</code> tags if
 you want the software center to have the same strings as the desktop menu.
 In some cases it might be required to have a different name in the app-store,
 but most <code>appdata.xml</code> files will not need these tags.
</p>

<h3>How do I translate this data?</h3>
<p>
 If you ship an <code>.xml.in</code> file rather than an <code>.xml</code> file,
 you can use a tool like itstool to translate the data.
 We've provided a <a href="appdata.its"><code>appdata.its</code></a> file
 for convenience.
</p>
<p>
 Translated descriptions are a really nice feature, as only a fraction of the
 userbase installing application will be able to understand English text,
 but for the technical preview we'll probably only be including the en_US text.
</p>

<h3>What format are the screenshots?</h3>
<p>
 Screenshots are only fetched by the software center when the long description
 is shown.
 Only translate these if a corresponding translated screenshot exists.
 Screenshots should typically be ~800px wide and should not exceed 1Mb in
 size.
 Either a lossy format '.jpg' or lossless '.png' format is permitted.
</p>

<h3>Are screenshots required?</h3>
<p>
 No, but we'd really hope you could ship at least one.
 A screenshot is a really good way of <i>previewing</i> the application before
 it is installed and a really good way of increasing your userbase.
</p>

<h3>Why not just use the package description?</h3>
<p>
 Different distros cut and join different source packages in different ways,
 plus, it's not typically translated.
</p>

<h3>Why not just use the DOAP description?</h3>
<p>
 This is one file per-project and is not suitable when one tarball will install
 several applications. It's also not translatable.
</p>

<h3>Why not just use a centralized web service?</h3>
<p>
 Put simply, we don't have the resources to moderate, check and translate each
 string for every application. We don't have the legal framework so that
 non-free applications could also ship application data.
</p>
<p>
 The upstream project is in a much better place to describe itself, and the
 upstream project is able to use it's existing localization and translation teams.
 Also, things like the screenshot will change as the project is updated, and
 not all distros ship the same version of an application.
 We also want the long description to come up immediately, and be searchable,
 so we can't really use a web service in that case.
 Additionally, different distros have different policies on trademarks.
</p>

<h3>What happens if I don't ship this file?</h3>
<p>
 The GNOME Software Center currently shows a nag message that the upstream project
 doesn't ship the additional data.
 Additionally, we will penalize apps that do not ship the extra metadata by showing
 them lower in the search results.
</p>

<h3>What other data should I include in the file?</h3>
<p>
 At this moment we're trying to do the bare minimum for a software center technical
 preview.
 In the future I can totally see this file being used to express what portals
 are required (i.e. <i>Firefox needs access to your addressbook</i>) and other
 useful things.
 I'll update this page when we've got some more concrete use-cases.
</p>

<h3>What is <code>updatecontact</code> used for?</h3>
<p>
 AppData is a new standard, and we'll likely be adding extra metadata in the
 future. If you include the <code>&lt;updatecontact&gt;</code> tag then someone
 will send an email when the standard is updated, detailing the new fields that
 you may or may not want to add to your <code>appdata.xml</code> file.
 We're not expecting to do this more than 4 times a year, so don't expect a
 deluge of email.
</p>
<p>
 <b>TIP:</b>Use <code>_at_</code> rather than <code>@</code> if you're worried
 about the email address being harvested.
</p>

<h3>Why XML and not JSON/other?</h3>
<p>
 AppData is a subset of the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/">AppStream</a>
 schema, which is also XML.
</p>

<h3>Is the <code>licence</code> tag supposed to be my project licence?</h3>
<p>
 No. The <code>&lt;licence&gt;</code> tag is indicating the licence that you
 are releasing the AppData text as.
 By ommitting the licence value would probably mean your data would not be
 incorporated into the AppStream metadata. Permissible licences include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CC0</li>
<li>CC BY</li>
<li>CC BY-SA</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where will this data be used?</h3>
<p>
 We will scrape this data when building and composing distributions, and depending
 on the implementation will either use an OCS server or directly copy the AppData
 data into the AppStream metadata.
</p>

<h3>How do I know if my appdata XML is correct?</h3>
<p>
 You can validate it using a <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a> schema
 available in <a href="appdata.rng">XML syntax</a> and 
 <a href="appdata.rnc">compact syntax</a> form.  This can be used with tools like
 <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html">xmllint</a>,
 <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a> and the 
 instantly validating
 <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/">nXML-mode</a> for Emacs.
</p>
<p>
 Note: This is available as a possibly helpful tool, it should not be seen
 as normative.  It is possible that the validation schema is too strict or too lax,
 and it might fail to be updated as the Appdata project evolves.
